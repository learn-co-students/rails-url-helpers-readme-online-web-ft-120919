This is much better, but to be thorough, let's make one last refactor: Rails is smart enough to know that if you pass in the post object as an argument, it will automatically use the ID attribute, so we'll use this implementation code:

<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div><%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %></div>
<% end %>
